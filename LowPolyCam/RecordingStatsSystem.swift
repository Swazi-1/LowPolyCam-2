/// 📊 Reusable recording stats system — live FPS, dropped-frame rate,
/// measured bitrate, and duration for the active take.
///
/// This is intentionally a standalone, additive module: it does not touch
/// AVAssetWriter, the writerLock, or any of CameraRecorder's existing
/// recording-path state. It is fed from the outside (append succeeded /
/// frame dropped / file grew by N bytes) and only computes/publishes
/// numbers — so it cannot destabilize the capture pipeline.
///
/// iOS 27 / Swift 6.4: snapshot is a Sendable value type; the tracker is
/// isolation-safe and published through CameraRecorder's @Observable state.
